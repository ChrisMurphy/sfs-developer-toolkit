# Standard Financial Statement: Data Definition Specification
Developed for the Money Advice Service by [Electric Putty Ltd](http://electricputty.co.uk).

## Naming convention notes
The intention of the convention is to make the element names as transparent and human readable as possible whilst maintaining a consistent pattern and keeping their lengths to a minimum.
	
1. All element names are based on the SFS Data Entry Excel
2. All 'short words' have been removed (e.g. &, and, or)
3. Where an element name contained additional content defined in parenthesis this been removed
4. All spaces have been replaced with hyphens
5. All letters are lowercase
6. All 'other' costs elements use their immediate patent element name - e.g other-professional
7. All 'total' elements use their immediate parent element name - e.g. total-earnings (this sometimes differs from their name on the Excel file)
8. Some element names have been shortened or restructured to simplify them and maintain consistency - e.g. 'Total salary and wages per month' appears as 'total-earnings'
